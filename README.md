# howAngry_TwitterBot

This twitter bot first ask the user to search for a hashtag, after searching for the hashtag, the bot will output 10 (this can be changed) tweets (excluding retweets) and scan them for either positive or negative words.

Currently, the bot usually only finds 1 or 2 pos/neg words since the list is quite low, I would still like to improve the accuracy of the bot so i can better determine if a tweet is positive or negative
I am going to use this data to generalise the publics opinion on certain topic (i made this to see what people thought of the new world of warcraft expansion, shadowlands)
